# Virtual Additions
This mod adds lots of content across various different aspects of the game. New blocks to build with, new mechanics to play with, and _much_ more can be found in this mod.

Many of the mechanics found in this mod are based on those found in some other mods throughout the game's history, but redone in a way that, to me, feels closer to how those mechanics would be implemented into the vanilla game.
